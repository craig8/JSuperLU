	 *	Postorder a tree.
	 *	Input:
	 *	  p is a vector of parent pointers for a forest whose
	 *        vertices are the integers 0 to n-1; p[root]==n.
	 *	Output:
	 *	  q is a vector indexed by 0..n-1 such that q[i] is the
	 *	  i-th vertex in a postorder numbering of the tree.
	 *
	 *        ( 2/7/95 modified by X.Li:
	 *          q is a vector indexed by 0:n-1 such that vertex i is the
	 *          q[i]-th vertex in a postorder numbering of the tree.
	 *          That is, this is the inverse of the previous q. )
	 *
	 *	In the child structure, lower-numbered children are represented
	 *	first, so that a tree which is already numbered in postorder
	 *	will not have its order changed.
